## Migration Guide

#### Breaking Changes

- **Provider Versions**: Minimum Terraform version increased to 1.5.0
- **Resource Names**: Some resources have been renamed for consistency
- **Module Structure**: Module inputs and outputs have been standardized

#### Migration Steps

1. **Update Terraform Version**

   ```bash
   # Check current version
   terraform version
   
   # Upgrade to >= 1.5.0
   # Follow Terraform upgrade guide
   ```

2. **Update Provider Versions**

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       google = {
         source  = "hashicorp/google"
         version = ">= 5.0.0"
       }
       google-beta = {
         source  = "hashicorp/google-beta"
         version = ">= 5.0.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update Module Calls**

   ```hcl
   # Before (v0.x)
   module "network" {
     source = "./modules/network"
     
     vpc_name = "my-vpc"
     project  = var.project_id
   }
   
   # After (v1.0)
   module "net_svpc" {
     source = "./net-svpc"
     
     project_id = var.project_id
     vpc_name   = "fintech-vpc"
     region     = var.region
   }
   ```

4. **Update Variable Names**
   ```hcl
   # Updated variable names for consistency
   # project -> project_id
   # cluster_name -> gke_cluster_name
   # db_instance -> sql_instance_name
   ```

5. **Migrate State (if needed)**

   ```bash
   # Import existing resources if resource names changed
   terraform import google_compute_network.vpc projects/PROJECT/global/networks/VPC_NAME
   ```
