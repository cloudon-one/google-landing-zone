# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policies, procedures, and guidelines for the GCP Landing Zone project. Our commitment to security ensures that this infrastructure provides a robust foundation for fintech applications requiring the highest levels of protection.

## 🛡️ Security Overview

### Security Principles

Our security approach is built on these fundamental principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data protection at rest and in transit
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security observability
6. **Compliance by Design**: Built-in regulatory compliance

### Threat Model

This landing zone is designed to protect against:

- **External Attacks**: Network intrusions, DDoS, malware
- **Insider Threats**: Privileged user abuse, data exfiltration
- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Service Disruption**: Availability attacks, resource exhaustion
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory non-compliance
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or infrastructure

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security details to: `security@cloudon-one.com`
3. **DO** include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if known)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Progress updates every 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Network Security

#### VPC Design
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Shared VPC Host Project"
        subgraph "Management Subnet"
            B[Bastion Host]
        end
        subgraph "GKE Subnet"
            G[GKE Private Cluster]
        end
        subgraph "Data Subnet"
            D[Cloud SQL]
            R[Redis]
        end
    end
    
    Internet --> B
    B --> G
    G --> D
    G --> R
```

#### Security Controls
- **Private Subnets**: All workloads in private subnets
- **NAT Gateway**: Controlled outbound internet access
- **VPC Service Controls**: Data perimeter protection
- **Private Google Access**: Secure access to Google APIs
- **Authorized Networks**: Restricted API server access

### Identity and Access Management

#### Service Accounts
```hcl
# Minimal privilege service account
resource "google_service_account" "gke_cluster" {
  account_id   = "gke-cluster-sa"
  display_name = "GKE Cluster Service Account"
  description  = "Service account for GKE cluster with minimal permissions"
}

# Grant only necessary roles
resource "google_project_iam_member" "gke_cluster_roles" {
  for_each = toset([
    "roles/logging.logWriter",
    "roles/monitoring.metricWriter",
    "roles/monitoring.dashboardEditor"
  ])
  
  project = var.project_id
  role    = each.value
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.gke_cluster.email}"
}
```

#### Workload Identity
- **Pod-level Identity**: Each pod gets specific GCP permissions
- **No Service Account Keys**: Eliminate long-lived credentials
- **Automatic Rotation**: Identity tokens rotate automatically

### Data Protection

#### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all storage
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Google Cloud KMS for key management
- **Envelope Encryption**: Additional layer for sensitive data

#### Database Security
```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "analytics_db" {
  name             = "analytics-db"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_15"
  region          = var.region
  
  settings {
    # Security configurations
    backup_configuration {
      enabled                        = true
      point_in_time_recovery_enabled = true
      start_time                    = "03:00"
      backup_retention_settings {
        retained_backups = 7
        retention_unit   = "COUNT"
      }
    }
    
    ip_configuration {
      ipv4_enabled    = false
      private_network = google_compute_network.vpc.id
      require_ssl     = true
      
      authorized_networks {
        name  = "bastion-host"
        value = google_compute_instance.bastion.network_interface[0].network_ip
      }
    }
    
    database_flags {
      name  = "log_connections"
      value = "on"
    }
    
    database_flags {
      name  = "log_disconnections"
      value = "on"
    }
    
    database_flags {
      name  = "log_statement"
      value = "all"
    }
  }
  
  deletion_protection = true
}
```

### Container Security

#### GKE Security Features
- **Private Clusters**: Nodes have no public IP addresses
- **Shielded GKE Nodes**: Verifiable node integrity
- **Binary Authorization**: Only approved images deployed
- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforce security policies
- **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation between pods

#### Container Image Security
```yaml
# Binary Authorization policy
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: binary-authorization-policy
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    defaultAdmissionRule:
      requireAttestationsBy:
        - projects/PROJECT_ID/attestors/prod-attestor
      enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
    clusterAdmissionRules:
      us-central1-a.gke-cluster:
        requireAttestationsBy:
          - projects/PROJECT_ID/attestors/prod-attestor
        enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
```

### Monitoring and Logging

#### Security Monitoring
- **Audit Logs**: All administrative actions logged
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring
- **Cloud Security Command Center**: Centralized security insights
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification of security events

#### Log Analysis
```bash
# Example queries for security monitoring

# Failed authentication attempts
gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.admin.v1.IAM.SetIamPolicy"
  AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail!=""
  AND protoPayload.status.code!=0'

# Unusual network traffic
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="gce_subnetwork"
  AND jsonPayload.connection.dest_port IN (22, 3389, 1433, 3306)
  AND jsonPayload.bytes_sent > 1000000'

# Service account key usage (should be rare)
gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.admin.v1.IAM.CreateServiceAccountKey"
  OR protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.admin.v1.IAM.DeleteServiceAccountKey"'
```
